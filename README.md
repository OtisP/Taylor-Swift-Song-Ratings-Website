# Taylor-Swift-Song-Ratings-Website

This project was an introduction to basic database manipulation, as well as experience building a website from scratch. It turned out pretty nice, and can be found here: (otis.pythonanywhere.com), where anyone will be able to help me rank the objectively best Taylor Swift songs.

It turns out it was fun to add functionality for a bunch of different artists, so I did it!
