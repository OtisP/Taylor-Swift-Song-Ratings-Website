IDEA: The goal will be to make a website that will comprehensively rank all Taylor Swift songs, by using some sort of ELO ranking system, and deciding between two

I've constructed a database of all Taylor Swift songs, and their album. It required a lot of manual input for the individual songs, but I figured that would be easiest. A little bit of Regex made it a lot less work.
I haven't yet taken databases (next semester!) but with some help from W3 tutorials I was able to do some very simple sqlite3 commands.

I've pulled an ELO formula online that should be good enough for what I need it for.
Worked with the databases to set up a way to pull two songs

Race conditions would be an issue with enough users. I'm going to count on low amounts of users while I haven't yet taken my databases class.

I was on a TEAR last night going off on this website. It turns out frontend is pretty easy to crank out. Added a lot of features. Some include: selectable album cover art, Spotify widget, a slider, the submit button that accurately changes the database, and it's a lot better as a whole now.

It required a decent amount of manual input to get all of the Spotify widgets in. I may be expanding to other artists as well, and if I were to do that I'd have to automate that data collection process. I'd also like to add a viewer that displays the current ranking of all the songs in a pretty way.
