I've constructed a database of all Taylor Swift songs, and their album. It required a lot of manual input for the individual songs, but I figured that would be easiest. A little bit of Regex made it a lot less work.
I haven't yet taken databases (next semester!) but with some help from W3 tutorials I was able to do some very simple sqlite3 commands.
