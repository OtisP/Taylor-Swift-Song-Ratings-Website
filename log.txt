IDEA: The goal will be to make a website that will comprehensively rank all Taylor Swift songs, by using some sort of ELO ranking system, and deciding between two

I've constructed a database of all Taylor Swift songs, and their album. It required a lot of manual input for the individual songs, but I figured that would be easiest. A little bit of Regex made it a lot less work.
I haven't yet taken databases (next semester!) but with some help from W3 tutorials I was able to do some very simple sqlite3 commands.

I've pulled an ELO formula online that should be good enough for what I need it for.
Worked with the databases to set up a way to pull two songs

Race conditions would be an issue with enough users. I'm going to count on low amounts of users while I haven't yet taken my databases class.

I was on a TEAR last night going off on this website. It turns out frontend is pretty easy to crank out. Added a lot of features. Some include: selectable album cover art, Spotify widget, a slider, the submit button that accurately changes the database, and it's a lot better as a whole now.

It required a decent amount of manual input to get all of the Spotify widgets in. I may be expanding to other artists as well, and if I were to do that I'd have to automate that data collection process. I'd also like to add a viewer that displays the current ranking of all the songs in a pretty way.

Added mouseover-text telling you current ELO of songs. Currently working on making the code more versatile for different artists.

Made the code FAR more general and it will now be much easier to do a different artist. The hard part will be writing a script to get the song lists and album covers. Depending on the artist, I could maybe just manually pull the images if that's to hard, but hopefully not.

I'm now trying to implement a script to get artists info from Spotify. I think using the spotipy module is the best way to do this, after a little research.

I was able to make a script to easily grab the names of all the songs of an artist. One issue that I had was, with Kanye West, a bunch of his music was re-released as the live version/cover/or just a straight up copy. There's work to be done on minimizing duplicate songs, but for now I'll just go through them manually and take them out.

Getting the URL to the image isn't actually that hard. For now I'm going to stick with downloading the images and saving them locally though.
